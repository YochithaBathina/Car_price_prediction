# Car_price_prediction

1. I have considered dataset from Kaggle and built a machine learning model to predict the selling price of the car with diffent attributes in the dataset.
2. In app.py I worte python code using flask libraries in order to deploy in the cloud platform
3. I have created a webpage(index_page) inside templates folder and which gives a outline of the project I have done and by selecting different attributes the output should be the car selling price.
4. I have deployed the code in Heroku platform by creating a app and the url for accessing is :https://carpredictionyochithabathina.herokuapp.com/
